# hello-world
Just another repository
Dear All, 
I am Gabriela. I love my Timoteo, my Mauri and my Emiliano. I have faced several challenges since I am not familiar with computer science but I really want to give it a try because I want to do a minor in Computational linguistics. I hope I gain some experience in this class. To conclude, I must add that I find coding an exciting but time consuming activity. 
Best regards,
XOXOXO
